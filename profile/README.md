## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è INTRODUCTION

> **Dar Lkhir** which means **House of the good** is a great idea that inspired all the first maintainers of this community. This small team believed in the same
> idea that as computer science students, we held a serious responsabillity towards our beloved society, and our beloved school ENSIAS. Also, since we believe in
> charity, we wanted to create the strong bridge between those who can give and those in need. That bridge is what we called **Dar Lkhir**.
